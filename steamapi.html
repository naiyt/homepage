		<p>For some reason I thought that I've had this on GitHub for awhile, but apparently not...anyway, I initially wrote this some time ago for a Steam related project that I scrapped, but then eventually used for <a href="http://steamplaytime.appspot.com">Steamplaytime</a>. It's handy, because the Steam Web API is certainly not well documented, and there are a lot of things that you SHOULD be able to do with the Steam API that you cannot. Thus, this wrapper also does some web scraping to get things like a list of all of a user's games, wishlists, and groups.</p>
