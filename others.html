		<p>If you take a look at my GitHub, you'll notice I have several projects at varying stages of completion. Here's some short info on some of those.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/naiyt/tarsnapgui">Tarsnap GUI</a> - <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> is my favorite backup provider. I thought that putting together a GUI interface for it could be handy for some people -- at least those not comfortable with the command line. On the other hand, that's not really Tarsnap's target audience. At the very least, it may be handy for getting a visual overview of your archives once it's done.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/naiyt/sublimesync">sublimesync</a> - A Sublime Text plugin more meant to solve a personal workflow issue. Syncs a local and remote directory -- makes it easy to work on a remote system while maintaining the benefits of working with directories in Sublime. (Ctrl-P in particular.) Local only supports Windows currently, and kinda buggy, but I use it for myself every day. Although I couldn't really recommend it to anyone else currently.</li>
			<li>Fire Emblem - It's sort of a pipe dream of mine to write a browser based implementation of Fire Emblem (one of my favorite game series). It would ideally have a map editor that users could use to create and play maps with each other. I've put together a few quick prototypes, but nothing major yet.</li>
			<li>Banner Improvements - Something I've recently started on. A browser extension to implement some improvements to my University's terrible courses system.</li>
		</ul>
