		<p>I've contributed a bit here and there to a few open source projects (and plan on continuing to do so in the future).</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/sarumont/py-trello">Py-Trello</a>:
				<ul>
					<li>Added fetch_actions() for the Board class</li>
					<li>Added support for public boards</li>
					<li>Added info_for_all_boards() - this method retrieves info for all of a user's boards</li>
					<li>Added webhooks support - methods for listing all of your current Trello webhooks, creating new ones, and deleting ones you no longer need</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt">Salt</a>:
			<ul>
				<li>I got invited to go to the "Salt Sprint" down in Salt Lake earlier a bit ago. This was fun, even though I had never really used Salt before. (Although I do want to -- I have a bunch of systems that I could use it with. I have my desktop, my laptop, two Raspberry Pi's, two VPS's, and an old computer. It would be nice to manage all of those using Salt.)</li>
				<li>During the Salt Sprint, I fixed some bugs and implemented a few Salt formulas</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/FogCreek/WebPutty">WebPutty</a>
				<ul>
					<li>WebPutty is pretty cool. In fact, I'm using it for all the CSS on this site, and started using it for the CSS on Steamplaytime. I only recently installed it and started using it, but I like what I've seen so far.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/FogCreek/WebPutty/pull/45">I recently fixed a set of bugs in the current version</a> that were preventing it from working under the current GAE version. Unfortunately, the project seems kind of dead, and the pull request hasn't been commented on or accepted. =\</li>
					<li>I have a few ideas on how to improve WebPutty that I'm currently working on. These include improving the performance of the editor (kinda laggy, to be honest) and adding linting to the editor. We'll see how far I get with those.</li>
				</ul>
