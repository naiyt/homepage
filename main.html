					<p>My name is Nate, and I have a website! I'm a programmer currently studying computer science at <a href="http://usu.edu">USU</a>.</p>

					<p>I love programming! There's a huge amount of joy that comes from creating something that wasn't there before, and the barrier between knowledge and application is surprisingly low with coding. I love picking up a new technology and making something from it.</p>

					<p>I realized that a software engineering career would be right for me when I noticed that I could go program at my part time job, then head to school to learn more about computer science, come home and do programming homework, and THEN start programming my own projects, and enjoy nearly every minute of it.</p>

					<p>Take a look at the links around this page to see some of my projects.</p>
