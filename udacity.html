		<p>I love <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>! (No, they didn't pay me to say that.) I first learned about it when reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun">Sebastin Thrun</a> and Google's self driving cars. When I heard that he was starting an online course to teach the programming behind self driving cars, I jumped on it immediately. I entered their first two courses on the day the site launched -- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Intro to Computer Science</a> taught by David Evans, and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs373">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a> taught by Sebastian Thrun himself.</p>

		<p>Udacity is pretty popular these days, and it was really fun to be there at the beginning. I hung out in the IRC channel (and actually created the first channel for CS101) and forums, and thoroughly enjoyed both classes. While I already had a solid base in programming, CS101 was still fascinating. David Evans is a fantastic instructor, and it was my first real exposure to Python. (Python is now my favorite language to program in.) I unfortunately had to stop listening to the AI for Robotics lectures about 4 weeks into the class, as I was running out of time between work, school, and taking Udacity classes. I did completely finish CS101 though.</p>

		<p>Since then, I've taken all of their web apps course (which was amazing), and portions of their programming languages and design of computer programs classes. I plan on taking more, as soon as I can devote the time to it.</p>

		<p>I've tried both Khan Academy and Coursera as well, but must admit that I definitely prefer Udacity's format and course quality.</p>

		<p>I've got the source for a few of the projects I did at Udacity up on GitHub. Be warned, these were class projects and I haven't touched most of them since the class finished, so the quality may vary.</p>

			<li><a href="http://wiki.natecollings.com/">Basic Wiki, also for Web Apps (thought I had this on GitHub as well, but I guess not; will have to dig it up)</a></li>
